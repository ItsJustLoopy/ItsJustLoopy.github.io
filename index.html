                        'Into The Rabbit Hole' is a 2D puzzle rogue-like game made in Godot with custom shaders and tiling system.
                        The idea for this game was inspired by games like 'Baba is you' where the rules of the world are being changed by the player.
                        In the game, the player is a rabbit constantly chased by wild animals and must move quickly, avoiding traps and collecting food
                        while searching for the exit or "the rabbit hole" to escape to the next level.
                        As the player progresses, they can edit the traits of all objects in the game, including the rabbit's appearance, movement, and behavior.
                        The player must be careful, as the wild animals also edit traits of their own along the way and are always on the lookout for the rabbit.
                        The game is designed to be challenging and fun, with a variety of levels and different object types to explore with each playthrough
                        being completely unique.
